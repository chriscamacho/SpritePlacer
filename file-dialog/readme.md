This file dialog has no other dependancies than libgdx.

I have made it to be usable on other projects other than Sprite Placer

It is rudimentry but usable, you will need to add an eventlistener
to the fileDialog object if you want to know when its returned
and you will also need to add it to your scene for it to work.
check for the event target being either the fileDialog public
fields ok and cancel
